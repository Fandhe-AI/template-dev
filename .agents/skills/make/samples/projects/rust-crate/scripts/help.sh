Operations in this sample crate, and how to run each directly (without
Make):

  doctor   scripts/doctor.sh    diagnose the environment only; never installs or repairs anything
  check    scripts/check.sh     cargo fmt --check + cargo clippy; never modifies source
  verify   scripts/verify.sh    cargo test --all-targets + cargo test --doc (required verification suite)
  build    cargo build          compile the crate
  test     cargo test           unit + integration tests only (verify.sh also runs doctests separately)
  clean    cargo clean --target-dir target   remove this crate's ./target only (never a shared CARGO_TARGET_DIR)

`make <target>` runs the same command shown above; Make is a thin,
optional front door, not a second definition of these operations.
